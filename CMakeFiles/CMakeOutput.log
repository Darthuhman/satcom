The system is: 8 [main] uname (12304) C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\uname.exe: *** fatal error - cygheap base mismatch detected - 0x1802F3408/0x1802F4408.
This problem is probably due to using incompatible versions of the cygwin DLL.
Search for cygwin1.dll using the Windows Start->Find/Search facility
and delete all but the most recent version.  The most recent version *should*
reside in x:\cygwin\bin, where 'x' is the drive on which you have
installed the cygwin distribution.  Rebooting is also suggested if you
are unable to find another cygwin DLL. - 1 [main] uname (11796) C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\uname.exe: *** fatal error - cygheap base mismatch detected - 0x1802F3408/0x1802F4408.
